# Working journal — live state

**If a session or an agent died, read this file first.** It is the durable record of what
is in flight, what is blocked, and what was decided. It is written DURING work, not after,
so a rate-limit kill or a crash leaves it usable.

**Rules for whoever writes here (lead or teammate):**
- Update it as you go, not at the end. A journal written at the end does not survive a kill.
- **NOW** and **BLOCKED** are rewritten in place — they describe the present, not history.
- **LOG** is newest-first and gets **compacted** when it passes ~40 lines: fold resolved
  entries into one line each, delete anything superseded. This file must stay short enough
  to re-read cheaply, or it stops getting read.
- Numbers here are pointers. The authority is `docs/STATE.md` + `docs/evidence/`.
- Never put a result here that belongs in STATE. This is working state, not findings.

**Last updated:** 2026-08-29, after three founder decisions and the P0-3 review.

## RESTART CHECKLIST — run this before anything else after a death

A usage limit kills a subagent outright; the session itself resumes
(`autoContinueAtUsageLimit`). The doorman does not know the agent died, because a killed
agent never fires `SubagentStop`. So the corpse keeps holding its slot, and the first
thing you try — re-dispatching the work that just died — is the thing it blocks.

1. **Read the journals.** `.claude/journals/lead.md` first, then the teammate's own.
2. **Reconcile live agents against held slots:**
   ```
   ls .claude/.agent-locks
   ```
   Compare with `ListAgents`. A lock with no matching live agent is a corpse — it frees
   itself after 30 min, or clear it now: `rm .claude/.agent-locks/<id>`.
3. **Check for parked work:** `ls .claude/.agent-queue` — refused dispatches live here and
   survive a death. The directory is gitignored, so nothing else will surface them.
4. **Then resume**, preferring the killed agent's uncommitted files over a restart.

## NOW — what is running

**Nothing.** Verified with `ListAgents`, zero subagents live.

## PARKED — work that was started and stopped

- **Court mask sweep: a possible gate pass, unclaimed.** `data/output/court_mask_sweep.json`
  was re-run; the arms changed shape (ablation -> routed) and the routed variants show **12
  accepted vs baseline's 11**. Committed as an artifact, deliberately NOT recorded as a gate
  result: the gate is >=12 of 20 AND zero accepted court more than 20 px from the human
  clicks, the precision half is absolute, and an accept count alone cannot clear it. Two
  changes have already died on exactly that. **Needs a qa run against the real gate** — this
  is a dispatch the lead can make, not a founder decision.

- **Corner contact sheets for the 25 `*_pts.json` files.** BLOCKED item 3 asks the founder to
  audit calibrations by rendering corners. Rendering is the lead's job, not theirs: build a
  sheet per file with the four clicked corners drawn on a real frame, so the founder's task
  drops from "audit" to "look and say which are wrong." No tool does this today —
  `validate_new_clip.py --audit` is residual-only, which is precisely what T23 defeated.

## BLOCKED — needs the founder, nothing proceeds without it

1. **Re-click `yt_match40` corners** in the court setup tool. Its calibration is confirmed
   wrong (trap T23) — all four clicked corners are off any court line, so the pipeline
   labelled the NEAR player FAR. Left near-baseline corner is unambiguous at ~(103, 448);
   `near_br_doubles` runs off-frame and needs extrapolating.
2. **Audit every other `*_pts.json` by RENDERING the corners**, not by reading residuals.
   `am_hard_utr` is "close but visibly skewed on the right." Lead builds the sheets; the
   founder only has to look.
3. **~3-6 human hours** for point-boundary labels (Hardcourt + Clay only; Shell and Grass
   have zero eligible footage and need new recordings).
4. **A TrackNet improvement idea the founder is holding** — stated 2026-08-29, not yet
   shared. Do not start ball-chain work until it lands; it may redirect the lane.

## DECIDED — binds everyone, do not reopen

- **iOS/iPadOS only, A13+**, Core ML/ANE the only inference target. **100% on-device
  forever** — a proposed network dependency is a scope violation.
- **Three live agents PROJECT-WIDE**, counting the whole tree — a teammate calling a
  teammate spends the same quota. Teammates MAY call each other. A Pro-plan QUOTA cap, not
  machine load; a one-word agent still costs ~38k. Enforced by
  `.claude/hooks/agent-cap.sh`; a refused call is PARKED verbatim, not lost, and handed
  back when a slot frees — never retry it and never shrink it to fit.
- **The rally/score layer is in scope but has no ground truth.** A compliant source is a
  prerequisite line item.
- Court auto-detection and the activity gate/trimmer are **not to be run unattended** —
  the first fires a stopping rule that closes a lane, the second needs a human to look at
  what it discarded.

- **v1 ships TRACKNET** (founder, 2026-08-29). The chain verdict was SPLIT, so this is a
  product call: fewer phantom balls beats more speed coverage, and it is the only detector
  with a Core ML path. BallNet v21 is the upgrade path, not a rejected option.
- **Line calling is PARKED** (founder, 2026-08-29). The 0.15/0.20 m refusal band is NOT
  chosen. `live.py` keeps its 0.05 m. qa's margin curve is filed in STATE, unactioned.
- **P0-3's substituted identity test is ACCEPTED** (founder, 2026-08-29).
- **P0-3 is no longer provisional** — 25 context tiles reviewed 2026-08-29. Both strict
  passes are real far-end figures; sampled rejections are real far players thrown out for
  anchor distance. The crop finds the far player.

## LOG — newest first

- **2026-08-29** — **P0-3 reviewed and STATE corrected.** Built
  `tools/p0_3_context_sheet.py` (full frame + blown-up crop, straight from the probe JSON,
  no model run, no court lines because the calibration is broken). Reviewing the 25 tiles
  **confirmed the crop finds the far player** — the two strict passes are real far-end
  figures distinct from the near-player box, and every sampled rejection is a real far
  player rejected for anchor distance, not a bad detection. **Caught a live rule-1 breach
  en route:** STATE quoted P0-3 as "15 of 25" — that is the POST-HOC relaxed criterion
  (far-sized person anywhere in the crop), while the pre-registered strict test is **2/25
  vs 0/25 control**. The evidence file labelled it correctly; STATE had dropped the label,
  and the lead repeated the unlabelled number to the founder. Row rewritten to carry both
  with their criteria. New design number: a ball-centred 192 px crop holds the far player
  only barely — **median 26.3 px from the crop edge**.
- **2026-08-28** — **pm's ranked queue is EMPTY.** Items 1, 2, 3 and 5 shipped; item 4
  (`bounce_hypothesis`) was measured and FAILED. Items 6 and 7 are the two pm ruled out for
  unattended work. Nothing further is dispatchable without a founder decision or a fresh
  sequencing pass.
- **2026-08-28** — `bounce_hypothesis` v2 **FAILED 4 of 7 bars** and does not ship (defaults
  unchanged, 468 tests pass). More valuable than the failure: it **disconfirmed its own named
  cause**. v2 removed `restitution_band` and gated tighter than v1, so the `wrong` rises
  should have gone to zero — they went 5 clips to 4. A one-variable ablation split the halves:
  removing the band is the good half, "more hypotheses" is the worse half. Reading the 17
  changed frames falsified the mechanism's core claim that a ghost fits neither hypothesis —
  the reflected hypothesis has its own false-acceptance region, covering a lock 502 px off
  track. **Correction to a claim the lead relayed:** `gate_ball_to_court` is NOT dead code —
  on gold caches it removes locks on 4 of 7 calibrated clips (`gold_sAjkpeRq4P4` -674). The
  earlier "14/14 no-op" was cache-family-specific.
- **2026-08-28** — Detector question **settled at the chain and the answer is SPLIT**, commit
  `2ead76a`. TrackNet: solid ghosts 88 -> 62 (-29.5%) for 8 hits. BallNet v21: more
  speed-confident shots, longer trails. `event_audit` underpowered. **This is now a founder
  decision**, because BallNet has no Core ML export path and TrackNet's ONNX already ships in
  `mobile/models/`.
- **2026-08-28** — **Concurrency doorman built, verified and fixed.** A cap kept only in
  CLAUDE.md could not hold, because the lead cannot see what its children spawn.
  `.claude/hooks/agent_cap.py` now counts every agent in the tree; a refused dispatch is
  parked verbatim and handed back when a slot frees. Teammates may now call each other.
  Measured: **~38k tokens is the floor for ANY agent**, so three at once is ~115k before a
  useful result; nested probe read BEFORE=1, INNER=2, AFTER=1.
  **qa passed it on nine checks and broke it on three.** The one that mattered: a read-only
  check is not a gate — counting had no side effect, so several dispatches in one message all
  saw the same free slot and all passed. Fixed with a reservation taken at approval time.
  Also fixed: sanitised agent ids colliding into one lock, and prompts truncated in the
  hand-back with no notice. Recreation guide at `master references/10`.
  **Two lead errors worth not repeating:** a `cd` leaked into a subagent's working directory
  (qa started in `master references/`, not the repo root); and Python's `write_text` silently
  rewrote seven LF files to CRLF, which the repo's own CLAUDE.md cap hook caught.

- **2026-08-28** — Detector comparison killed by usage limit. **Lesson: nothing restarts a
  dead subagent.** `autoContinueAtUsageLimit` resumes the SESSION; a subagent that hits the
  limit is killed outright and no mechanism polls for it. The failure notification IS the
  restart trigger — treat it as one, do not just report it.
- **2026-08-28** — Audio screen: **0 bail-outs of 88 clips, 0 of 62 Shell.** The feared
  correlated audio/vision failure on echo-heavy indoor courts did not occur. Two findings:
  the binding threshold is level-dependent (58-65% of candidates discarded on quiet indoor
  venues vs 17-25% outdoors — same class as the unscaled 720p constants), and
  `impact_envelope`'s rolling median is O(n·win) with a **13.5 GB peak allocation** on a
  28-min clip, never hit because nobody has run it on a full match. Committed `cae1dcc`.
- **2026-08-28** — Refusal band measured (qa). Both real mounts at/below the floor within
  10 cm; clear it from ~20 cm. `live.py`'s shipped `line_margin_m = 0.05` sits inside the
  unreliable zone. **qa correctly refused to write to the codebase** — its charter forbids
  it and my brief wrongly asked. Its findings still need filing by the lead.
- **2026-08-28** — P0-3 rebuilt. Crop finds the far player where full frame does not
  (0/25 control vs 15/25 crop192@640), and the mechanism is **upscale factor**, peaking at
  ~100-140 px of player in the tensor — a transferable design number. Found en route that
  `yt_match40`'s calibration is fabricated, which **withdrew P0-2's yt_match40 column**.
  Commits `10ed80f`, `8454e7e`.
- **2026-08-27** — P0-2 FAILED its gate: pose downscaling destroys the far player
  (11.0% → 0.1% → 0.0%). Closed full-frame downscaling as a way to afford pose on an A13.
- **Two lead errors worth not repeating:** sent execution work to `researcher`, which has
  no `Bash` by design; and claimed an agent was running without calling `ListAgents`.
  Match the task to the agent's `tools:` first, and verify state before asserting it.
